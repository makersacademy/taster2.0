Pre course
================

Before writing your first line of code, you need to install many many things.
Let's sum them up quickly:

- Git (For version control, team work, remote, etc)
- Github (To have a visual platform of git and much much more)
- Ruby (Our OOP language)
- Heroku (The company that will host our website for us)
- A text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") or [Sublime Text  3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime text 3"))

This is definitly not an exhaustive list, but it will be enough for the Taster weekend

> If you are looking for your terminal, open spotlight and look for Terminal.app or you can direclty find it in your applications folder

Notices
================

###Good Practice
DO NOT COPY PASTE !!!
If you do so, you will never really memorized all the tags and how they are working together !

As Evgeny wrote in Taster v1:
>You're strongly encouraged to type in all code instead of copy-pasting it. This will really help your understanding of how everything works.
We can't stress this enough. Copy and Paste is the DEVIL!! Even though at times you will be copying chunks of code, the simple process of typing it yourself will help you learn. Trust us. You can't cut corners.

###Organization
We strongly advice you to start a makersacademy directory somewhere in your computer
In order to keep all your work organize and from the experience we have now, you can organize this directory with this structure:
- makersacademy
  - Taster
    - HTML Challenge
  - Pre-course
  - week 1
  - week 2
  - ...

Let's code !!!

HTML Challenge
================

Now that you understood:
  - What is HTML ?
  - Why is it essential to know how to play with it ?

We will create our first webpage step by step!

### Section 1: Hello World ! (20 min)
Let's start by simply reproducing the picture bellow !

![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/Hello%20world.png)

To do so you will need to:

1. Open your text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") or [Sublime Text  3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime text 3"))

2. Create an index.html file

3. Create a title

4. Make your title becoming a link that goes anywhere you want

5. Right click on your index.html file and open it with your web browser

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code

> **Bonus challenge:**
Open the link in an another tab - you can check: "attributes on html links" on google

Show off ! You just created your first html page !

We will soon push it live, but you've just learnt something essential, you first work locally and when you've got the result you expected, you can push it live !

### Section 2: Design your thought ! (30 min)
Now that you know how to see your code in a web browser, let's start to think like a real developer !

Before starting to code, we need to think, plan and organize our self ! Talk as much as you can with your pair !

1. Pick a theme that you like
2. Take a paper and a pen and draw your mock ups
Here an example of mock up, make it way more simple, this is a difficult example to begin:
![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/mockup%20example.gif)
3. Think how you will build it
4. Think how you will build it
5. Think how you will build it
6. Write the name of your tags on all the elements you've designed
7. Make a new folder for your images
  - makersacademy
    - Taster
      - HTML Challenge
        - assets
          - images
        - index.html
8. Code your structure

If you have trouble remembering all the tags we've seen during the course, [take this pill :pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/blob/master/assets/pills/html.md "Taster v1"), Glups

Hum... There is a little issue right ? Every elements are below the other ... Should we style it to make it pretty !?

### Section 3: Make it pretty !

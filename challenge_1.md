Challenge 1 - Structure your app

  - How to play with it

Look what we can build today !

[You can see it live here](https://taster-challenge-2.herokuapp.com/ "Challenge_2")

>This is just an example, you can build whatever you want, but try not to do something too complicated..

### Section 1: Hello World ! (20 min)
Let's start by simply reproducing the picture bellow !

![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/Hello%20world.png)

To do so, follow the instructions below:

1. Open your text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") or [Sublime Text  3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime text 3"))

2. Create an index.html file

3. Write the doctype, head and body like we have seen during the lecture

4. Write a title (inside your body)

5. Make your title (h1) a link. It can go anywhere you want

6. Right click on your index.html file and open it with your web browser

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code

> **Bonus challenge:**
Open the link in an another tab - you can check: "attributes on html links" on google

Show off ! You just created your first html page!

Tomorrow, we will push it live, but you've just learnt something essential!                                             You first work locally and when you've got the result you expected, you can push it live.

### Section 2: The first real step (30min)

The first thing you really start with is... not coding.

1. Take a pen, paper and draft [the website](https://taster-challenge-2.herokuapp.com/ "Challenge_2") with all of its elements
  - Menu
  - Article (title, text and picture)
  - Footer
2. Talk about it in your pair
2. Write on each block the name of the tags which will be the skeleton of your website
4. Talk about it in your pair

You can do that, but simpler

### Section 3: Code the HTML structure of your website (30min)

Now you can code what you've put on the paper

1. Go back on your text editor, delete the inside of the body
2. Start coding what you've done on paper

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code
Write attributes


If you have trouble remembering all the tags we've seen during the course, [take this pill :pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/blob/master/assets/pills/html.md "Taster v2"), Gulp

Hmm... There is a little issue, right? Every element is below one an other ...

Should we make it pretty!?

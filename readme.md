###Good Practice
DO NOT COPY PASTE !!!
If you do so, you will never really memorized all the tags and how they are working together !

As Evgeny wrote in Taster v1:
>You're strongly encouraged to type in all code instead of copy-pasting it. This will really help your understanding of how everything works.
We can't stress this enough. Copy and Paste is the DEVIL!! Even though at times you will be copying chunks of code, the simple process of typing it yourself will help you learn. Trust us. You can't cut corners.

###Organization
We strongly advice you to start a MakersAcademy directory somewhere in your computer
In order to keep all your work organize and from the experience we have now, you can organize this directory with this structure:
- makersacademy
  - Taster

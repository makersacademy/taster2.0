Challenge 2 - Make it pretty !
================

### Section 1: Make the bridge ! (15 min)

As you've seen during the lecture, we need to make some links between the HTML pages and the CSS pages.

1. We need to tell the HTML page where is the stylesheet

If you want to be sure that the link is correctly done, put something like that in your css file:

```css

body {
  background: lightblue;
}

```

### Section 2: Create the blocks ! (1h30)

1. Let's start by the menu, It needs to be:
  - On the top, right
  - Needs to be a block that push other elements underneath
  - It has the "monospace" font
  - The link (make it open in a new tab)

Write meaningful classes and Ids in order to let a non coder person understanding what you are styling.

For example:

Do not write classes like :
  .x or .y, etc

Prefer:
  .menu .menu__ul .menu__li

3. Go on with the article and then the footer

([take this pill :pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/css.md "Taster v1") if you have some trouble)

To not loose your mind with CSS, you need to be careful and not write on top on the other rules.
That's why, we recommend you to code the structure of your page first and after to make it pretty.

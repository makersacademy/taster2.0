### Section 2: Design your thought ! (30 min)
Now that you know how to see your code in a web browser, let's start to think like a real developer !

Before starting to code, we need to think, plan and organize our self ! Talk as much as you can with your pair !

1. Pick a theme that you like
2. Take a paper and a pen and draw your mock ups
Here an example of mock up, make it way more simple, this is a difficult example to begin:
![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/mockup%20example.gif)
3. Think how you will build it
4. Think how you will build it
5. Think how you will build it
6. Write on the paper all the name of your tags on all the elements you've designed


### Section 4: Build it ! (30 min)

We will now code our page !

1. Make a new folder for your images
  - makersacademy
    - Taster
      - HTML Challenge
        - assets
          - images
        - index.html
2. Start to code the structure and put your content inside

If you have trouble remembering all the tags we've seen during the course, [take this pill :pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/blob/master/assets/pills/html.md "Taster v1"), Glups

Hum... There is a little issue right ? Every elements are below the other ...

Should we style it to make it pretty !?

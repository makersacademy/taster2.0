#You can see it live here

### Section 1: Hello World ! (20 min)
Let's start by simply reproducing the picture bellow !

![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/Hello%20world.png)

To do so you will need to:

1. Open your text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") or [Sublime Text  3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime text 3"))

2. Create an index.html file

3. Write a title

4. Make your title becoming a link that goes anywhere you want

5. Right click on your index.html file and open it with your web browser

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code

> **Bonus challenge:**
Open the link in an another tab - you can check: "attributes on html links" on google

Show off ! You just created your first html page !

We will soon push it live, but you've just learnt something essential, you first work locally and when you've got the result you expected, you can push it live !

### Section 2: The first real step (30min)

The first thing you really start with is actually not coding.

1. Take a paper, a pen, and draft the website with all of its element
  - The menu
  - The article (title, text and picture)
  - The footer
2. Talk about it with your pair
2. Write on each blocks the name of the tags that will be the skeleton of your website
4. Talk about it with your pair

You can do something like that but way more simple.

### Section 3: Code the HTML structure of your website (30min)

Now you can code what you've put on the paper

1. Go back on your text editor, delete the inside of the body
2. Start coding what you've put on paper

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code
Write attributes


If you have trouble remembering all the tags we've seen during the course, [take this pill :pill:](https://github.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/blob/master/assets/pills/html.md "Taster v2"), Glups

Hum... There is a little issue right ? Every elements are below the other ...

Should we style it to make it pretty !?

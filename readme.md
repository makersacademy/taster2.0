###Good Practice
DO NOT COPY PASTE !!!
If you do so, you will never really memorized all the tags and how they are working together !

As Evgeny wrote in Taster v1:
>You're strongly encouraged to type in all code instead of copy-pasting it. This will really help your understanding of how everything works.
We can't stress this enough. Copy and Paste is the DEVIL!! Even though at times you will be copying chunks of code, the simple process of typing it yourself will help you learn. Trust us. You can't cut corners.

###Organization
We strongly advice you to start a makersacademy directory somewhere in your computer
In order to keep all your work organize and from the experience we have now, you can organize this directory with this structure:
- makersacademy
  - Taster
    - HTML Challenge
  - Pre-course
  - week 1
  - week 2
  - ...

Let's code !!!

HTML Challenge
================

Now that you understood:
  - What is HTML ?
  - Why is it essential to know how to play with it ?

We will create our first webpage step by step!

### Section 1: Hello World !
Let's start by simply reproducing the picture bellow !

![hello world image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makersacademy/taster2.0/master/assets/images/HTML%20Challenge/Hello%20world.png)

To do so you will need to:

1. Create a folder
2. Create a index.html file
3. Write some code :)

Let's stop talking and build something real !

Open your text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") or [Sublime Text  3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3 "Sublime text 3"))

Create an index.html file

Create a title

Make your title becoming a link that goes anywhere you want

Right click on your index.html file and open it with your web browser

> **Good practices:**
Indent your code

> **Bonus challenge:**
Open the link in an another tab - you can check: attributes on links html on google

Show off ! You just created your first html page !

We will soon push it live, but you've just learnt something essential, you first work locally and when you've got the result you expected, you can push it live !

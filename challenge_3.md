Challenge 3 - Be agile !
================

Ok so now that you've got all the vision about the agile methodology, let's make it happen !

1- We want to organize our self so we will first start with defining the vision we have for the project.                  
2- We can now identify the stackholders and write some users stories.                             
3- Once we get a bunch of user stories we can move to the scrum board.  
4- Create a new repo in your github.
5- Create an account on: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/ "Waffle.io") with your GitHub account.
> Add directly your public repo.

6- We can now organize the ideas into sprints that we will put in the different columns, the to do will have the first                              sprint.      

7- For the backlog, we need to be careful and to not ask too much, say no when it needs to be said.

>You've seen today how long it took to you to do the Challenge 1 and 2 so be aware about what you are capable of and try to plan something for tomorrow.                                                                                       **You will have about 3h30 coding time, today you had 2h30.**

8- Quote the tickets into priorities and time.                                                          
9- Start to draw the mockups.                                                          
10- Think about the structure of your website.                                                          
11- Divide the tickets into the team.                                                          
12- You are ready to go.
